I am AJ -

I enjoy learning and problem solving, and I am sick enough in the head to prefer using Vim over an IDE most of the time. 
~~As soon as I figure out how to write an adequate vimscript to handle most of the extra things an IDE does it will be all the time!~~ We will be switching to NeoVim before going down that rabbit hole XD.

I enjoy low level programming, particularly with C, but have spent a copious amount of time in Java, and recently the Javascript/CSS/HTML stack.

I am working on a (very much WIP) [portfolio](https://segedi-uw.github.io/) and I also have a currently largely inactive [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-segedi-5a6036142?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BB4JT1nwARLi4o6CYjiD8hQ%3D%3D).
