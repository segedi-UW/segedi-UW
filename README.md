I am AJ

I enjoy low level programming, particularly with C/C++, but have spent a copious amount of time in Java, and recently the Javascript/CSS/HTML stack.

If you are interested in me profesionally, here is my [portfolio](https://segedi-uw.github.io/) and I also have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-segedi-5a6036142?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BB4JT1nwARLi4o6CYjiD8hQ%3D%3D).

Feel free to [email me](mailto:aj.segedi@gmail.com) for inquiries.
